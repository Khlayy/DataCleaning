# Studio Ghibli Data Cleaning Project
Welcome to the Studio Ghibli Data Cleaning Project! ðŸŽ¬

## Description
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing the Studio Ghibli dataset using SQL. As an anime fan and enthusiast of Studio Ghibli's iconic films, I embarked on this project to explore the dataset, address inconsistencies, and ensure data quality for further analysis and visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about Studio Ghibli films, including details such as title, director, release date, and revenue. It offers a fascinating glimpse into the world of Studio Ghibli and provides ample opportunities for analysis and exploration.

## Objectives
Clean and standardize data entries to ensure consistency and accuracy.
Handle missing or null values effectively to maintain data integrity.
Perform data transformations and corrections as needed to enhance usability and clarity.
Prepare the dataset for downstream analysis and visualization tasks.

## Project Structure
Data Cleaning Scripts: SQL scripts used to clean and preprocess the Studio Ghibli dataset.
Documentation: Additional documentation, notes, and insights gathered during the cleaning process.
Final Dataset: The cleaned dataset ready for further analysis and visualization.

## Getting Started
To explore the data cleaning process and access the cleaned dataset, simply clone or download this repository to your local machine. You can then execute the SQL scripts using your preferred database management system or SQL client.

## Contributions
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you identify any issues or have suggestions for improving the data cleaning process, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Your contributions help make this project more robust and valuable for the community of Studio Ghibli fans and data enthusiasts.

## Acknowledgements
Special thanks to the creators of the Studio Ghibli dataset for making it publicly available, and to the Studio Ghibli team for bringing us countless magical moments through their timeless films.

Let's embark on this data cleaning journey together and uncover the hidden treasures within the Studio Ghibli dataset! ðŸŒŸ
